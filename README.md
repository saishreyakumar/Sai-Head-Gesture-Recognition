# Head-Gesture-Recognition
# Head Gesture Detection Application

This application is designed to detect simple head gestures ("Yes" for nodding and "No" for shaking) using a webcam feed in real-time. It employs OpenCV for video capture and facial recognition, alongside basic motion detection algorithms to interpret head movements as responses to a displayed question.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A working webcam connected to your computer.
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts and command-line operations.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the source code** to your local machine.

2. **Install required Python libraries** by navigating to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file in your terminal or command prompt, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command installs all necessary libraries, including OpenCV, which is essential for the application to run.

### Running the Application

To start the application, navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`your_script_name.py`) and run:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
